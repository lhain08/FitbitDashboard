## Project Fitbit Dashboard
Link: [https://github.com/lhain08/FitbitDashboard](https://github.com/lhain08/FitbitDashboard)

## Overview
The **Fitbit Dashboard** project will provide users with a customizable option for viewing their data. With the Fitbit Dashboard, they will be able to select a chart type, choose the data type they want to display, and set more flexible goals.

## Semester Plan
For the semester the plan is to build the application to allow users to import their fitbit data and create a dashboard custom for their own personal use. The user will be able to add or remove certain blocks of information that best fit how they would like to use their fitbit information. All of the information from fitbit will be available for the user to see, if desired. By the end of the semester, the application should be functional to the point of importing the data and displaying it based on the user’s customization.

## Technology
The technology stack will be flexible, however the initial plan will be to use Python and the Dash library to create quick and responsive dashboards.
